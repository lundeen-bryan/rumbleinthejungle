 (1) Changes to previous versions:
     - Added type hints for improved clarity and maintainability.
     - Replaced multiple pop() calls with slicing to skip the first two lines of the file.
     - Utilized splitlines for robust and consisten line splitting.
     - Procesed the M3U8 content lines in pairs to extract resolution and URL
     - Integrated Kodi's xbmc.log for error logging during processing
     - Reveresed the list of URLs to maintain the original behavior
